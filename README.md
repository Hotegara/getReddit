# getReddit
There are three parts to this project:

1. Gather Content
  I. Get popular comment (threads) and submissions from Reddit via PRAW
  II. Store data in objects locally and on a DB
2. Create Media
  I. Convert text from comments and submissions into speech mp3's
  II. Dynamically create images from submissions and comments via Pillow module
  III. Combine audio and images with music and generic background clips to form youtube shorts/tikToks
3. Share Media
  I. Upload media to accounts on TikTok and Youtube, (likely via Selenium)
